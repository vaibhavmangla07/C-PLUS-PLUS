 ## **🧠 C-PLUS-PLUS — Learn & Practice C++**

Welcome to the **C-PLUS-PLUS** repository!  
This collection contains **C++ code examples, practice problems, and concept demos** as I learn and build my skills in the C++ programming language.

## 🚀 Overview

This repo is a part of my C++ learning journey where I solve different problems and build code examples covering basic to intermediate topics. It’s designed for learners who want to follow along or refer to clear, working C++ examples.

## 📚 Topics Covered

Included examples and exercises:
- Basic syntax (variables, I/O)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Functions & recursion
- Arrays, vectors, strings
- Sorting algorithms
- OOP concepts (classes, objects)
- Linked lists & stacks
- Problem solving from **GeeksforGeeks** & **LeetCode**

*(Update this list with topics you actually have.)*

## 🛠 Getting Started

To run the examples locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vaibhavmangla07/C-PLUS-PLUS.git
```
2. **Navigate into the folder:**

```bash
cd C-PLUS-PLUS
```
3. **Compile a C++ file:**

```bash

g++ -std=c++17 filename.cpp -o output
```
4. **Run the program:**

```bash
Copy code
./output
```
You can use any C++ compiler or IDE (like VS Code, Code::Blocks, CLion, etc.)
